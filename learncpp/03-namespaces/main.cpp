/*
Takeaway
1. A name declared in a namespace wonâ€™t be mistaken for an identical name declared in another scope.
2. The :: symbol is an operator called the scope resolution operator. 
3. Avoid using-directives (such as using namespace std;) at the top of your program or in header files. 
They violate the reason why namespaces were added in the first place.
